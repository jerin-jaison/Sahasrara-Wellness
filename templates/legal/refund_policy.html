                    <p>If you wish to cancel your appointment, please notify us as soon as possible. While we do not
                        offer refunds, giving us early notice helps us manage our therapists' schedules.</p>

                    <h2>2. Re-scheduling</h2>
                    <p>We understand that plans can change. You may re-schedule your appointment under the following

                        <li>A booking can be re-scheduled a maximum of two times.</li>
                        <li>Subject to therapist and slot availability.</li>

                    <h2>3. Booking Fees & Charges</h2>
                    <p>Some premium slots or specific services may incur a <strong>10% service charge</strong> or
                        booking fee that is used to secure the therapist's time. This fee is non-refundable and will be
                        clearly marked during the checkout process.</p>

                    <h2>4. No-Show Policy</h2>
